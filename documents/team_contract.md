# Communication 

__Team Meetings__
+ We will have one meeting per week and decide to have it at cst 9 pm on Friday. 
+ The meeting will take one hour each time and we will have it on zoom. 
+ The meeting will be recorded directly.

__Assistance__
+ We will contact with each other by WeChat, a communication App on smart phone. 
+ Since we are in different time zone, we will respond each other within 12 hours.

__Respect__
+ Everyone will have a fixed time(about 10 mins) to show his own idea in every meeting and others will listen to him carefully. 
+ We will also have a fixed time to have a discussion about those ideas.

# Collaboration

__Work Distribution__ 
+ All team members are responsible for determination of the project background, the leading question, and the graph algorithms to use. _zh22_ particularly leads the part of data acquisition and processing given his background in transportation. _tqian3_ particularly leads the part of code structure construction given his advantage in coding. All team members will roughly divide the task of implementation and writing.
+ The distribution of additional work depends on availability of team members. The member who has the maximum availability will take care of this unexpectated situation.

__Time Commitment__
+ Each team member is expected to work 7 hours per week, which is approximately the amount of one MP based on our MP performance. 
+ The weekly meeting time and the consultant time with our assigned TA is not counted into the time commitment.
+ As stated in work distribution, the extent of availability is a primary factor for unexpected cases.

__Conflict Resolution__
+ We use semi-weekly and weekly checking machanism to check everyone is on the same page. On every Tueday, we will do peer checking by text. On every Friday, we will have a zoom meeting. When a member miss his task for two weeks, we will have a course staff involved.
