/**
 * @file Graph_prim.h
 * This file defines Prim's algorithm. 
 * Prim's (also known as Jarn√≠k's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. 
 * This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
